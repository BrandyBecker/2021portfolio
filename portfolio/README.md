# Portfolio Website
This website is my 2021 portfolio. In it you can find my projects I've worked on, my blog posts, and mroe information about me. 
2021 is going to be my year, and the year I excel, so I'm starting it out with a new portfolio. I plan to document my journey as much as possible within the Blog.

# Day 1
- Setting up my project. Installed React, starting development of Nav Bar and making it mobile-first so that the website remains mobile friendly start-to-finish.
